# Project Overview

In this project, we apply data engineering skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

This folder contains real messages that were sent during disaster events and categories elaborated by https://appen.com/
messages.csv
categories.csv

We will be creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

In this folder we include two jupyter notebooks
- Project Workspace - ETL where we are elaborating an Extraction Transformation Loading process

and 

- Project Workspace - ML Pipeline where we are developing a predictive model to classify these messages
