    "**The more we increase latent features the higher the accuracy in the train set, and the lower the accuracy in the test set. This happens because the more latent featurs we use the higher the risk of overfitting. It looks like 200 latent features is the optimum solution. I might want to run A/B testing to evaluate a recommender system. Here's how this is possible with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/using-a-b-testing-to-measure-the-efficacy-of-recommendations-generated-by-amazon-personalize/). Machine learning (ML)-based recommender systems aren’t a new concept, but developing such a system can be a resource-intensive task—from data management during training and inference, to managing scalable real-time ML-based API endpoints.  Amazon Personalize allows you to easily add sophisticated personalization capabilities to your applications by using the same ML technology used on Amazon.com for over 20 years.**"
